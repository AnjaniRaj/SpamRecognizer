aVthe hilton chicago locat on prime real estat in downtown chicago has not age as grace as other hotel around the countri open dure the same period of time the hotel doe maintain the appear of luxuri that has made it icon but that luxuri is not in accord with 21st centuri standard lack ani form of fit center the hilton is almost alon among the major hotel of chicago in forc it patron to go elsewher for a quick workout even nomin fee for wireless internet use in hotel room is veri rare at this point and the outrag park fee of 43 for guest will discourag out of towner from make the hilton their destin most guest room are no differ than ani other hilton anywher mean that unless you are stay in the admit fantast execut suit you will be pay a premium for a prosaic hotel experi
p39
aVthis hotel is locat right in the hustl and bustl of the citi of chicago it is ideal for the corpor execut not onli in term of locat but the hotel offer a spectacular view of the ocean the dine room is spacious and make eat at this hotel a realli pleasant experi while dine the guest experi a nice ambianc as they overlook the citi which is picturesqu especi at night when the citi light come on the room are nice and spacious and allow the guest to get all their work done with a desk area i would strong recommend this hotel for the corpor execut

aVwhen you stay at a hotel like the jame just from their price point you expect a certain level of qualiti if i pay well over 500 dollar for a room i do not think it unreason to expect not onli a qualiti room but also a certain level of standard of servic perhap this hotel should renam itself the lebron jame becaus it has about as much class as he doe and is about twice as pretenti a hand of babi powder thrown into my face would have been a refresh break from the level of servic i receiv at the lebron jame my night of hell began with the clerk bellboy or whatev he was at the front desk who fake what i assum was intend to be a british accent but end up as an unholi meld of australian and new england a british accent doe not make you fanci or skill onc i made my way past mr belveder and to my room i was disappoint not onli by it size which was unusu small but also a faint scent of cigarett not a strong one but i could definit smell smoke not accept then while i was sleep a deep throb sound began to eman from the wall it sound technic mechan like an air conditin malfunct despit mani reassur from the front desk the throb continu on throughout the night i demand the man at the front desk come up and rectifi the situat immedi but from what i could tell he never came

aVthe hotel monaco is a hotel that some say has charact i found the decor tacki and had a hard time relax in the room design with clash color and contemporari furnitur i found the fact that you have to be a member of the kimpton reward club to get free wifi access to be annoy at the least becaus of their petfriend polici our room smell like a wet dog and a canin guest down the hall kept us up all night with his howl perhap the dog would have howl less if the 24hour room servic were faster we wait an hour and a half for our order mean we did not get our dinner we want at 1000 pm until midnight all in all we would not stay here again the view and locat are great but for the money there are better place to stay in chicago

aVat the intercontinent chicago you pay for more than a room you pay for an experi let me elabor i was a bit reluct to pay a premium for locat and amen like ani novic travel to chicago i saw the mass glut of cheap accommod out in the suburb and those were origin what i set my sight on price is a power signal and the sheer discount of those option drew me in but after do a bit of research i realis that distanc doe have it cost the price of transit in the chicagoland area isnt free and it far from what im use to car use is price prohibit i knew that origin which is whi i wasnt go to drive but the sting of use the automobil park congest toll road etc get shove off onto taxi fare and auto rental so i ultim had to end up look for a place well connect with mass transit but mass transit has it cost too which meant that stay at a focal point downtown had it advantag that what origin drew me to intercontinent but intercontinent is much more than the right room at the right place the decor of the room and the amen avail to the guest are unsurpass i was travel on intern busi so the eas with which i could transact in foreign currenc was a draw they had a currenc exchang right there on the premis and the fact that massag dri clean and event plan were avail inhous was a huge plus my work get me tie up in knot it also leav littl time for do chore so the abil to grab a massag while my suit were be finish was a relief for me but on top of all that the event plan was what put intercontinent over the top be abl to coordin a comprehens tour of chicago while complet my busi and manag my person life was a weight off my shouldersand someth i wont forget in the end if your a newcom to chicago stay in a timecrunch the intercontinent is for you the pricetag of room downtown can seem prohibit but when you factor in the conveni and save in margin cost it noth in the end and the intercontinent is not onli pricecompetit with the other downtown option it also make stay downtown the conveni and thrill it should be
