aVwhen you stay at a hotel like the jame just from their price point you expect a certain level of qualiti if i pay well over 500 dollar for a room i do not think it unreason to expect not onli a qualiti room but also a certain level of standard of servic perhap this hotel should renam itself the lebron jame becaus it has about as much class as he doe and is about twice as pretenti a hand of babi powder thrown into my face would have been a refresh break from the level of servic i receiv at the lebron jame my night of hell began with the clerk bellboy or whatev he was at the front desk who fake what i assum was intend to be a british accent but end up as an unholi meld of australian and new england a british accent doe not make you fanci or skill onc i made my way past mr belveder and to my room i was disappoint not onli by it size which was unusu small but also a faint scent of cigarett not a strong one but i could definit smell smoke not accept then while i was sleep a deep throb sound began to eman from the wall it sound technic mechan like an air conditin malfunct despit mani reassur from the front desk the throb continu on throughout the night i demand the man at the front desk come up and rectifi the situat immedi but from what i could tell he never came

aVthe hotel monaco is a hotel that some say has charact i found the decor tacki and had a hard time relax in the room design with clash color and contemporari furnitur i found the fact that you have to be a member of the kimpton reward club to get free wifi access to be annoy at the least becaus of their petfriend polici our room smell like a wet dog and a canin guest down the hall kept us up all night with his howl perhap the dog would have howl less if the 24hour room servic were faster we wait an hour and a half for our order mean we did not get our dinner we want at 1000 pm until midnight all in all we would not stay here again the view and locat are great but for the money there are better place to stay in chicago

p1112
aVi was veri much look forward to our stay at this hotel after hear all the good thing about it unfortun it was a veri underwhelm experi to say the least but let me begin with the thing that i do like about the hotel first off it is locat my favorit part of chicago  the leafi affluent part of town that is chicago equival of manhattan upper east side complet with sidewalk quiet treelin street real oldschool townhous instead of ugli tower monstros that are 21st centuri condominium cute boutiqu instead of gap banana republ and other mainstream massproduc brand and of cours herm of pari which warrant a separ mention i also like the small intim lobbi area with old leather couch cherri color wooden furnitur area rug and distinct artwork the veri reason whi i alway tend to gravit toward smaller boutiqu hotel instead of imperson chain i definit love the room while the space issu is not as bad in chicago as it is in manhattan get a 400sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easi task so we were delight to see that our room come with generous ampl bathroom doubl sink massiv king bed and still enough space to walk around do a chicken danc and strut my herv and louboutin in my onli reserv was the lack of natur light  the window were definit inadequ to allow sunlight to find it way into our 11thfloor room but then again delawar st is not exact the widest street in town and there are build in front of us so cant have it all yet one thing that realli disappoint us was the servic or lack thereof i mean serious they dont call it the hospit industri for no reason i did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutiqu hotel such as this so i do get a servic that is a littl bit more person than the kind that i would be get from say a 3000room vega hotel first i call in to reconfirm my reserv the ladi on the phone was anyth but courteous and compet first off she was not abl to find my reserv and i was transfer to the front desk staff to whom i had to explain myself all over again my pet peev when it come to onthephon custom servic the person who man the recept desk was not friend nor was he at all compet either case in point  he had to send the slip of paper on which i agre to the night rate and durat of stay up to the room after we check in which clear indic that he must have forgotten when we were actual down there but the real kicker was when we order room servic after arriv  it was about 1am as a general rule i am never ever a big fan of room servic have had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18 gratuiti 105 tax and still expect a tip on dure my day globetrot on the compani expens account think overcook steak lukewarm soup bread hard enough to knock someon out and icecream that are alreadi half melt by the time it reach your suit so i realli wasnt expect hotel as small as talbott to have a 24hour room servic but lo and behold they do i place an order of chicken blt which to my initi delight came in within 20 minut then after the customari of the invoic and the involuntari yet customari tip of 2 on top of the 18 servic fee refer abov i open the cover onli to find someth that look like it was pick up from the garbag bin microwav and serv on a plate with a bag of lay chip light salt flavor the bread look like someon stomp on it the l and t look like it was 2 day old the b was unrecogniz and the chicken was burnt and cold it was pathet room servic at it finest we did get the item taken off our bill right so too but the front desk person was instead of apologet defiant the whole thing was just veri upset and for a hotel as highend as this to be abl to leav such a bad impress within the first hour of arriv it quit an accomplish in and of itself we wont be come back unfortun
p1113
aVwe stay here becaus of all the great review and it all true we were high impress with the high qualiti of everyth everyon and the locat walk distanc to much of what chicago has to offer gibson steakhous and the hancock build to name a coupl this hotel should realli be in the top ten or even top five hotel for chicago it should also have more than three star i mean three star is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard and this place far exceed chain hotel like those depend on the room you get ani price under 250 would be a good deal between 250  300 could still be worth it
p1114

p1319
aVthe locat of this hotel was excel as it is just besid the subway and the bus stop for the free trolley bus to navi pier is just besid the hotel the room was veri spacious kind of too big for a solo travel the view from the room was excel and it was a great view to sleep at night the bathroom was spacious too and the room has a big wardrob the kitchen has microwav oven and cook utensil some of the cook utensil were a bit dirti probabl becaus they had not been use for sometim howev the microwav oven was veri use as i can heat up food to eat at night you can easili walk to the magnific mile by cut across the shop mall across the road do check out pizzeria uno which is near the hotel that serv the delici deep dish pizza for cheaper food do check out the foodcourt at the shop mall the hotel also serv breakfast and dinner from mon to thur i did not find the food that fantast but it was pretti decent i will strong recommend this hotel to everyon go to chicago
p1320
aVwe book thru hotwir which we have a high percentag of posit outcom i was veri happi when we saw that we would be stay at the knickerbockera i had stay when i was younger we reserv a king nonsmok upon arriv we were told that they did not have that and we onli had the choic of a smoke room when argu they state well you book thru hotwir so you do not have prioriti as we enter the room i notic the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on we call the front desk and they fix the door but not the light later that eve as i took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towel also i must add the room reak of smoke the next day when we check the front desk clerk ask how our stay was and when we told him the problem he told us the total and had not concern of our issu we also check in our bag for the day and the bellmen came quick and made veri rude comment about us hurri up so he could get on with his day we realiz a bit later that we forgot someth in one of the bag and was told they would not get them back out stay awayeven if you get a good deal
p1321
aVi was veri happi with my stay at the knickerbock the room were nice and the staff was excel i was abl to stay here for 80 per night thru pricelin that was an incred bargain in my opinion  this hotel is veri nice it has an excel locat  just off of michigan ave all of the best shop in chicago can be found right around the corner it a great locat  veri close to mani great attract if there is ani negat it would be that there is no swim pool but i think that is common with a lot of the older hotel in chicago i would defin recommend this place  hope i will be abl to stay there again in the futur
p1322
aVthe locat of this hotel is excel the hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say  in my opinion the room decor is horribl probabl more european than i am use to and the room is small and furnish like an old apart on the upsid if you want to stay in a great locat feel safe and can put up with some aesthet issu and can get a great deal then this will work i prefer westin or marriottsometh that you can count on
p1323
aVstay there three night from 41709 through 42009 checheck in about 915 am had to wait about 15 minut becaus of special request i had made room was quiet and comfort mark improv over last time i stay there about 5 year ago the renov were great and maintain the old time charm of the hotel
p1324
aVthis hotel has the worst room we have stay in dure the last 10 year the first room they gave us was a shock tini and the bathroom was a joke you had to step insid move out of the way just to shut the door the furnitur is disgust and all the wood trim was veri beat up and paint over about 100 time so they transfer us to the execut suit that room had a tini bathroom i mean tini the furnitur was hideous and dirti it was on the 3rd level so you heard everi convers on the street below and traffic was loud the onli impress part is the lobbi but dont be fool becaus after that  the floor abov look like they need a major overhaul and the room were not worth even 100 per night we stay there a year ago becaus we got stuck through pricelin deal i dont think we want to do pricelin again onli becaus they have the knickerbock as a 4 star hotel and we dont ever want to go back there again 2 star at best for the dumpi knickerbock they should be asham of themselv for even allow guest to stay in those room boomer napervill il
p1325

p1329
aVwe realli enjoy our brief stay at the millennium knickerbock from the front desk personnel and bellmen to the housekeep staff and bartend everyon we met was help and welcom our 11thfloor room was clean and beauti and the view look north to the drake hotel and apart across the street was nice the inroom coffe servic was appreci too there isnt a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletri but id still take a room in a beauti older hotel with charact over a spaciousbutcookiecutt room ani day
p1330
aVbefor book this hotel i did read the review and i was concern i end up book it base on my sister recommend big mistak the temperatur in chicago was a balmi 99 degre and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degre when we call to complain at 1100 am they told us to turn the temp down to 40degre we went back at 730pm it was still humid the bed were moist  the room veri stuffi call again they sent somon to fix it  he recommend get a new room becaus the room will not cool down they told us they were book yet after the mainten man call they sudden had a room avail go figur so they move us to anoth room guess what it is 85 degre again they told us to turn it down to 40 needless to say it never cool down  we should have just slept on the street we travel a lot and we stay here one night and it was aw at check out i had to retel our entir room issu they actual end up not charg us for the night thank god they did not offer us anoth night stay becaus we would never go back also the room decor is veri old and stuffi if your go to chicago dont stay at the millenium knickerbock
p1331
aVok we are back from the knickerbock and i would give it the best rate i cant believ the bad review i got a pricelin deal and i still got a fine room clean uptod furnish ok a littl tradit for my tast and smoke free someon said in anoth thread that some peopl write prank review i think such peopl should get a life becaus peopl want to read the truth here it is from my point of view both room on 10th floor regard the size of the room we had two room one was a 2 doubl bed room it was about 20 x 15 each doubl bed had valenc that were kind of minicanopi the furnitur bathroom tile shower no tub wall paper and paint had been done in the last few year a chines inspir cabinet held tv coffeemak ice bucket and minibar three separ level tv icecoffe and minibar the other room was call queen execut this one had queen bed with more of a canopi than valenc sofab two tvs and terri bathrob also about the same size but differ configer one tv face the bed other in the three level cabinet the sofab smoke in the lobbi there is a bar to the right of the entranc it is an open arrang so that i am sure the smoke come from bar to entranc door no smoke smell in nosmok room cost of room 75 on pricelin plus tax veri good valu one block from n michigan ave onli complaint concierg said that the free trolley didnt go down michigan ave to field museummuseum complex when in fact it doe was this ignor or tri to throw more busi to taxi either case not good he said at this time of year free trolley onli goe to navi pier dure winterwhich is clear incorrect
p1332
aVthe histor feel of the hotel realli had a strong influenc on my choic to book this hotel unfortun the ambianc of the hotel could not make up for the rest of it shortcom the front desk staff was rude the doormen were usual busi chat or play on their cell phone instead of greet us or open the door there are three elev but good luck with them all work they are veri veri small and when onli one is up and runningyou end up wait a long time for one not fun when you are on the 12th floor the room was tini and the air condit did not work at allth room felt damp and miser we put the thermostat as low as it would let us 65 and the room never went below 78 and it was 107 outsid the whole trip there realli are no amen insid the hotel other than an ice machin and a slight overpr restaur internet is not free either overal i would never stay here again
p1333
aVmy wife and i had to stay downtown for event that we were attend at the drake hotel i have stay at the drake befor and while it is nice it is bit stuffi and a littl outdat for the price we opt to walk across the street and stay at the millenium instead i know this properti has under gone mani renov in past year and i have to say they have done a great job this place use to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to chicago on a colleg roadtrip i did but that is not the case ani more this properti is direct across from the drake hotel and for 12 the price you get their great locat with a newer albeit smaller room and everi ammen you would expect from a 4 hotel the room are tast decor asian influenc wflat screen tv and the bed is veri comfort the bath is small no tub but veri clean and the shower is great you are not go to be spend a bunch of time in your room when vist chicago so the room size is not a big deal it work well with a coupl but a famili of four may be a bit cramp the servic was attent and friend and the locat cant be beat i would definit stay here again but the next time i would leav the car at home 49night park is a bit steep
p1334
aVthe aircondit has a noisi fancompressor in each room it start everi 3 to 5 min and the nois will wake you up at least the first night this is an old fashion system that need to be replac the postal servic at the hotel is nonwork the hotel mess up our concert ticket that was correct address and transport by up the ticket were at the hotel general manag offic the recept deni that they had arriv we had to spend most of a day travel to the ticket agent to resolv it the hotel did not find ani reason to apolog for the inconveni the concert was the reason for our travel to chicago els the hotel had good standard free internet in the lobbi not to good view from the room and friend staff at the restaur and the bar we had book 20 roomnight all togeth stay at room 612 425 and 431 from the 23rd june

p1338
aVour suit at the knickerbock are quit nice but the behavior and attitud of the staff is beyond abysm first a member of the staff enter our room midday unannounc onli to apolog after realiz that he fail to verifi that we were present not a tremend problem but when the young woman at the front desk repli what do you want me to do about it with the tone of a flippant teenag i began to suspect that a sever defici in manner may have been evid in the staff fast forward to this even follow a love meal off the premis we chose to turn in a bit earli at 1130 pm onli to discov that despit our best intent the bass from a parti downstair was more than audibl in our room act prudent and with restraint we decid to phone the front desk to inquir as to whi our room had been inadvert annex into the parti downstair but yet again we were met with a curt and quit rude respons sean at the front desk inform us that the parti was a greater prioriti for the hotel and that the famili dictat that the music was to be set at a certain volum on one hand i appreci his honesti but on the other i truli would have prefer that he at least pretend to care about the guest who chose to stay at his properti sinc were out of option for the even weve decid to stay up and tri to watch tv for the time be but given the circumst the staff could have easili made up for the negat situat that aros in quick success also i was alarm to learn that while i slept the prior night a possibl gangrel shoot took place mere block from the properti this wouldnt have been a concern if like nearbi hotel the knickerbock chose to enlist ani type of secur measur within their lobbi would i stay here again mayb on a dare or if someon els was foot the bill yet ive had better experi in road side motel and the employe train regimen could use a serious revamp to better serv the interest of the guest and more import simpl common sens
p1339
aVmy first trip back to chicago in about 7 year was perfect i chose the knickerbock as i had read that their room were recent renov on top of be a great locat to michigan avenu rush street and downtown chicago i must say i was veri impress with the guestroom i had not stay there prior but it definit is a refresh from what ive seen in photo post on the review the guestroom are nice decor with a modern feel and they are good size for a histor hotel the bed are wonder  i need to get a pillow top mattress at home i use the internet access with no issu and i love the larger screen tvs the shower is fun with the differ type of shower head you can choos and the bathroom are fresh with all new granit and tile im anxious to get back to chicago and it wont be 7 year from now i would high recommend this hotel  fantast guestroom locat and staff ive ad some digit pictur of my room as they are complet differ from the one i saw on previous review with the new renov
p1340
aVlocat is excel but dont valet your car there5300 a day bed was to soft pillow were flat we couldnt open up the mini bar cabinet becaus the bed was in the way all in all not what youd expect from a hotel in that area
p1341
aVwe absolut love the knickerbock now if you expect your hotel to be cooki cutter comfort forget this place if holiday inn are like the row of hous develop in the suburb the knickerbock is like those beauti old hous in the center of the citi the locat is great the hotel bar is cozi and classi and the room feel like guest bedroom in victorian mansion for the price you simpli cant do ani better than this in downtown chicago
p1342
aVwe book this hotel for an adult weekend away on pricelin paid 85 which thought was good price for a 4 in downtown chicago the locat is great the hotel minim ok unsur how it get a 4 rate it is old and though clean the decor is definit jade and need a face lift staff were pleasant and overal it was a good stay howev i would not recommend this hotel i would rather have paid 100 and got someth more updat  troubl with old it tend to look somewhat seedi and this was true in this case my suggest do not book pricelin for chicago il and ask for 4  becaus this is what you are almost sure to getnot good enough pricelin in my opinion
p1343
aVother review complain about the small room for a major citi we found our room quit comfort with a king bed and realli nice furnish one featur we like is the abil to open the window the knikerbock is a small boutiqu hotel right off michigan avenu in the best area of chicago the staff was friend and help for the 116 we paid on hotwir we could not have found a better room in downtown chicago
p1344
aVjust return from a one night stay at the knickerbock and i will not return it came nowher near be worth the price i paid hotel burnham is twice the hotel at half the price the bathroom was unbeliev small and smell terribl we had to call the front desk twice befor towel that we request were deliv which frank may as well have been paper towel noth plush about them at all we didnt have enough pillow and when we request an extra it was never deliv room servic cart was left outsid our door all night all in all it was a veri disappoint stay the onli redeem qualiti of this hotel seem to be it locat and for me it just not worth it
p1345
aVwe were greet by staff with excel custom servic skill our room was such a pleasant surpris from the flat screen tv the full size shower with rain showerhead  hand held shower wand the wall attach toilet with flush option on the wall the comfort bed the love light option etc the size of the room was snug and veri comfort as would be in a histor hotel it was also quiet and i know that the hotel was sold out my sister was in the room next door we did not hear her tv we also love walk less than a block to the shop and restaur on north michigan avenu

p1420
aVmy wife and i frequent stay downtown for a night in the citi we have been to mani hotel in the downtown chicago area my opinion of the swissotel  spend your money elsewher and get a much better experi the swissotel has a veri cold atmospher and it veri difficult to feel comfort the room was averag at best howev the cost per night was far from averag the view from our room face a construct site which is a soon to be trump build that will block the lake view from the hotel other hotel are also a coupl block closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more our room and the lobbi area had a strang smell and someon was actual vacuum the hallway floor at 800a which woke us up we call the front desk to complain and were extrem shock to be treat rude by the person at the desk we also had a coupl of friend come downtown and they were wait in the lobbi when they were approach by a gentleman ask if they were guest of the hotel they said no but that they were wait on us and he actual ask them what our name were and then they look it up to verifi that we were on the guest regist he didnt even apolog to them for the inconveni and imbarrass overal it was just an unpleas experi becaus we were expect top notch treatment spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off michigan avenu for real top notch servic anyon give this hotel a top review obvious hasnt had the opportun to stay at a nicer hotel in the area

p1423
aVthe swisshotel is awesom veri high class it is expens  but so is everi hotel in chicago it is off from the dingi area of our citi  yet a long walk to navi pier so you will need to pay for the cab note to all the magnific mile is bore as can be i live in chicago and the hotel is a better experi than the mile of navi bore pier

aVi usual stay at the hotel monaco but stay at the allegro becaus most the monaco was book while the allegro is similar to the monaco in it decor less tradit and more funki interior it is not near as nice the linen are not as high qualiti as the monaco and the room are not decor as nice the room are also smaller the main reason i would not recommend the hotel though is the bathroom it has an old tile floor with an old sink and old toilet it remind me of someth you would find in a men locker room although the allegro has instal a nice mirror it doe not make up for the limit counter space and dingi apper also the layout of the bathroom is terribl the toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sit in your lap as you sit on the toilet also the room is not veri clean as well the floor in my room was dirti and i found crumb in the drawer i would recommend stay at the monaco hard rock or soffitel for a hotel that is a littl less tradit but still nice

aVthe hotel is excel situat for visit the art institut or millennium park it is an old classic of a hotel and the main lobbi is a must see but i would not stay there again the problem with ani hotel date from long ago the current one was built in 192325 is that even with extens remodel which was done in 20072009 it is hard to creat space that are compar to what is expect today in mani case the wall are load bear so cannot be chang too much we had a reason size room king bed and space for a desk and loung chair but the bathroom was veri small with littl space to spread out toiletri also there was no coffe machin in the room  someth i have come to expect in virtual all hotel these day my major complaint about this stay was the execut loung it is usual worth while to pay the extra for access  in most hotel it is not much more than the cost of two breakfast and there are usual some hor doeuvr in the even along with a modest wine at a modest price sinc we are current at the diamond level in the hilton honor program we get access for free at the hilton but i usual upgrad at other chain such as the hyatt at the palmer execut loung i order a coupl of glass of wine there was a bartend on duti and was slight surpris by the cost  9glass which came to 2144 for two with tax and tip  and was even more surpris by the wine it was about the worst wine i had tast in mani year i didnt think it was even as good as trader joe cheapest 299 wine that i tri a coupl of week ago unfortun i didnt get a look at the bottl to see what it was although i did notic that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard i notic that a coupl of group in the execut loung had brought their own wine in  and i can understand iot at the price they were charg it then occur to me that the wine had been sit around open for some time i check the room servic menu and saw that they offer three red wine by the glass  the same three variet as at the bar the cabernet was a william hill at 1050glass from room servic i presum that what i had had at some time been a william hill that had been left to turn to vinegar it was slight more expens from room servic but i hope that it was in a lot better condit
